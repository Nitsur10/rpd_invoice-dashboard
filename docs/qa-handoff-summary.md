# QA Handoff Summary — 2025-09-18

## Build & Lint Status
- `npm run lint` → warnings only (legacy unused imports); no blocking errors.
- `npm run build` → success; Next.js 15.5.2 production build generated without issues.

## Playwright Regression Suite
- Command: `npm run test`
- Result: ⚠️ Full suite still pending (sandbox server bind). Targeted rerun of `tests/e2e/detailed-investigation.spec.ts` now passes against mock-backed invoices API.
- Command: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/invoices.spec.ts --reporter=list`
- Result: ✅ 12/12 passed on Chromium/Firefox/WebKit (Supabase tables still missing, API routes fell back to mock data).
- HTML report: `playwright-report/index.html`
- Artefacts: refreshed screenshots under `screenshots/`
- UI refresh (2025-09-19): invoices page and filter surfaces now honour updated RPD light palette; export/refresh/clear buttons provide inline feedback.

## Key Fixes Included
1. **Lazy Supabase Initialization**: Browser/server helpers instantiate clients on-demand, preventing env timing errors.
2. **Custom Playwright Launcher**: `scripts/playwright-dev-server.ts` injects `.env.local` before starting Next.js, ensuring consistent env vars.
3. **Test Documentation Updates**: `docs/testing-reports/playwright-2025-09-18.md` and `docs/baseline-audit.md` capture the green run.
4. **Invoices Filter Enhancements**: Drawer/sidebar, saved views modal, export progress UX, and inline calendar + quick presets wired to refreshed `/api/invoices` stack.

## Recommended QA Activities
- Spot-check the Playwright HTML report for any flaky retries.
- Re-run invoice-filter smoke (`tests/e2e/invoices.spec.ts`) from a host that permits Next.js web server binding the tsx IPC pipe.
- Review updated screenshots to confirm visual baselines.
- Validate env documentation in `docs/baseline-audit.md` aligns with Supabase/Vercel settings.

## Next Actions for Documentation Agent
1. Compile QA pack (this summary, Playwright report, baseline audit) for stakeholder sign-off.
2. Draft release notes summarising auth/test hardening.
3. Coordinate with Deployment Agent for Vercel preview once enhancements kick off.

## UI Adjustments (2025-09-19)
- Removed the API Status navigation entry; status content now lives in internal tooling only.
- Restored dashboard hero focus with branding limited to the sidebar and gradient headings on `/invoices` and `/kanban`.
- Updated automated tests and visual baselines to expect the new titles.
