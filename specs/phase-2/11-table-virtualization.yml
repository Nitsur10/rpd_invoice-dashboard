name: "[IDASH] Row Virtualization for Invoices Table" 
description: |
  Implement row virtualization for the invoices table to handle large datasets efficiently.
  Ensure rendering performance stays constant regardless of dataset size.

labels:
  - "repo/invoice-dashboard"
  - "phase-2"
  - "performance"
  - "virtualization"

priority: "medium"

acceptance_criteria:
  - Table renders only visible rows regardless of dataset size
  - Smooth scrolling performance with large datasets (1000+ rows)
  - No layout thrash or janky scrolling behavior
  - Maintains current sorting, filtering, and selection functionality
  - Works seamlessly with server-side pagination from Task 10
  - Constant rendering performance as data grows

files_to_modify:
  - "src/components/invoices/data-table.tsx"
  - "src/components/ui/optimized-table.tsx" (may create)
  - Package dependencies (add virtualization library)

technical_requirements:
  - Use @tanstack/react-virtual or similar virtualization library
  - Maintain current @tanstack/react-table functionality
  - Implement proper row height calculation
  - Handle dynamic row heights if needed
  - Preserve scroll position during data updates
  - Support keyboard navigation and accessibility

implementation_steps:
  1. Research and select appropriate virtualization library
  2. Install @tanstack/react-virtual or alternative
  3. Create virtualized table component wrapper
  4. Integrate virtualization with existing react-table setup
  5. Handle row height calculations and measurements
  6. Test with various screen sizes and data sizes
  7. Ensure accessibility features still work
  8. Performance test with 1000+ rows

performance_targets:
  - Table initialization under 100ms regardless of row count
  - Smooth 60fps scrolling with any dataset size
  - Memory usage scales with visible rows, not total rows
  - No frame drops during rapid scrolling

quality_gates:
  - Performance profiling shows constant rendering cost
  - Smooth scrolling with 1000+ row test dataset
  - All existing table functionality preserved
  - No accessibility regressions
  - Table remains responsive during rapid interactions
