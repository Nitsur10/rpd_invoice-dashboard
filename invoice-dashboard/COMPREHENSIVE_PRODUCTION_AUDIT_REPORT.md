- Some chart colors may not be accessible for color-blind users

**Recommendations:**
```css
/* Enhanced gold contrast for accessibility */
--color-gold-accessible: oklch(0.55 0.12 80); /* Darker gold */

/* Improved focus states */
.focus-enhanced:focus-visible {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px oklch(var(--color-primary) / 0.3);
}
```
