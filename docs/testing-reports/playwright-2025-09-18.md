# Playwright Regression Suite — 2025-09-18

## Overview
- **Command:** `npm run test`
- **Environment:** Local machine using the Playwright-specific dev server launcher (`scripts/playwright-dev-server.ts`) with `.env.local` Supabase credentials.
- **Result:** ✅ 78/78 tests passed across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit projects.

## Highlights
- Lazy Supabase client initialization resolved the previous `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` runtime errors.
- Visual review suite captured fresh screenshots for all core pages.
- Performance snapshot (WebKit) reported load time of ~1.3s with no oversized images detected.

## Artefacts
- Playwright HTML report: `playwright-report/index.html`
- Screenshot gallery: `screenshots/`

## Follow-up
1. Update `docs/baseline-audit.md` to record the successful regression run.
2. Mark Testing Agent as complete in `data/orchestrator-state.json` and transition to Documentation QA.
3. Archive the report with the corresponding commit for audit trail.
