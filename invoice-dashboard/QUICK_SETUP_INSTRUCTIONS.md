# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Deploy Table Schema

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://auvyyrfbmlfsmmpjnaoc.supabase.co
2. **Click "SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
3. **Copy the entire contents** of `DROP_AND_CREATE_TABLE.sql`
4. **Paste into SQL Editor** and click **"RUN"**

## Step 2: Import Spreadsheet Data

Once the table is created successfully, run:

```bash
node scripts/import-invoices-from-spreadsheet.js data/current-invoices.xlsx
```

## Expected Results

### After SQL Script:
- âœ… Table "Invoice" created with 32 fields
- âœ… All performance indexes created
- âœ… Auto-timestamp trigger active  
- âœ… Test record inserted and deleted successfully

### After Import Script:
- âœ… All spreadsheet tabs processed
- âœ… Tab names retained in `source` field
- âœ… Duplicates removed based on key fields
- âœ… All 32 fields mapped correctly
- âœ… Data ready for dashboard

## Verification Commands

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check total records
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_invoices FROM "Invoice";

-- Check tab sources  
SELECT source, COUNT(*) as invoice_count 
FROM "Invoice" 
GROUP BY source 
ORDER BY invoice_count DESC;

-- Sample records
SELECT 
  invoice_number, 
  supplier_name, 
  total, 
  source,
  invoice_date
FROM "Invoice" 
LIMIT 5;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Working

- **Tab Name Retention**: âœ… Each invoice shows original spreadsheet tab in `source` field
- **Smart Duplicate Removal**: âœ… Based on invoice_number + supplier_name + total + invoice_date
- **Complete Field Mapping**: âœ… All 32 spreadsheet fields preserved
- **Dashboard Ready**: âœ… Data structure matches application expectations
