# Middleware Access Verification (2025-09-17)

## Summary
- Reviewed `middleware.ts` to ensure `/auth/login` is correctly whitelisted after the segment migration.
- Confirmed `PUBLIC_PATHS` allows `/auth/login` and supporting auth APIs, preventing redirect loops for unauthenticated visitors.
- Verified redirect logic persists the `redirectTo` query parameter, ensuring post-login navigation returns users to their intended route.
- Ensured authenticated sessions are redirected away from `/auth/*` to the dashboard, avoiding redundant login prompts.

## Implementation Notes
1. `isPublicPath` now references a centralized set of public routes that covers `/auth/login`, `/api/auth/set`, `/api/auth/signout`, and health endpoints.
2. Middleware only instantiates the Supabase server client for protected routes; public paths return early with `NextResponse.next()`.
3. Redirects build on the incoming request URL, retaining query strings and preventing open redirect vectors.
4. `auth.set` API mirrors Supabase cookie state to keep middleware and client session helpers in sync after login.

## Outstanding Checks
- Manual verification of `/auth/login` and redirected dashboard flow in a local environment with Supabase credentials.
- Confirm Supabase session cookies propagate correctly between middleware and Playwright via `/api/auth/set` once E2E tests can run outside the sandbox.
