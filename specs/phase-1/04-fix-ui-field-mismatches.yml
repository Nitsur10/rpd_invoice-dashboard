  camelCase references. Use computed status from due_date where needed.

  - phase/1
assignees: []
milestone: Phase 1 â€” Stabilize & Secure
acceptanceCriteria:
  - Columns/actions use `invoice_number` and `file_url` correctly.
  - No references to `invoice.invoiceNumber`, `invoice_url`, or `payment_status` remain.
  - Stats computed consistently via helpers (e.g., determinePaymentStatus).
files:
  - invoice-dashboard/src/components/invoices/columns.tsx
  - invoice-dashboard/src/app/invoices/page.tsx
steps:
  - Replace legacy field references with canonical snake_case fields.
  - Use determinePaymentStatus(due_date) consistently for status.
  - Verify actions (copy/open) work with new fields.
