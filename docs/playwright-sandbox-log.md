# Playwright Auth Flow Status (2025-09-17)

## Attempt Summary
- Command: `npm run test`
- Result: Failed before Playwright could open the login page.
- Error: `listen EPERM: operation not permitted 127.0.0.1:3002` while starting the dev server defined in `playwright.config.ts`.

## Diagnosis
- The sandboxed environment forbids binding to local ports (Seatbelt restriction), so Next.js cannot launch on `127.0.0.1:3002` for end-to-end runs.
- No Playwright assertions executed; the failure occurs during the web server bootstrap phase.

## Next Steps for Testing Agent
1. Re-run the suite on a machine or CI runner where port binding is allowed.
2. Provide Supabase credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `E2E_USER_EMAIL`, `E2E_USER_PASSWORD`) so `ensureTestUser` can provision the test account.
3. Capture the first successful run report and attach it to `docs/testing-reports/` for the quality gate review.

## Resolution
- Local rerun on 2025-09-17 still failed: missing Supabase env vars prevented the app from booting. Updated notes in `docs/testing-reports/playwright-2025-09-17.md`; rerun once env keys are exported.
