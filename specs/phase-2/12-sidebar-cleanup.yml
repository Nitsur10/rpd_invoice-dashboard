name: "[IDASH] Sidebar: Replace Inline Style Mutations with Classes/Tokens"
description: |
  Clean up sidebar component to use proper CSS classes and design tokens instead of 
  direct DOM style mutations via onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave handlers.

labels:
  - "repo/invoice-dashboard"
  - "phase-2" 
  - "ui-cleanup"
  - "accessibility"

priority: "medium"

acceptance_criteria:
  - No onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave style mutations in sidebar component
  - Hover effects implemented with CSS classes and Tailwind utilities
  - Same visual behavior as current implementation
  - Better accessibility and performance (no JS style mutations)
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code
  - Consistent with design system patterns

files_to_modify:
  - "src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx"
  - "src/app/globals.css" (if custom hover states needed)

technical_requirements:
  - Remove all direct style object assignments in event handlers
  - Use Tailwind hover: variants for interactive states
  - Use CSS custom properties for color values if needed
  - Maintain current visual design exactly
  - Ensure smooth transitions and animations
  - Support dark mode if applicable

implementation_steps:
  1. Audit current sidebar.tsx for style mutations
  2. Identify all hover effects and color changes
  3. Create equivalent Tailwind classes for hover states
  4. Replace onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave with CSS classes
  5. Test all hover interactions work identically
  6. Verify accessibility and keyboard navigation
  7. Clean up any unused style-related code

current_issues_to_fix:
  - Direct style mutations: `e.currentTarget.style.background = '...'`
  - Inline color assignments: `e.currentTarget.style.color = '...'`
  - JavaScript-based hover state management
  - Performance overhead from event handlers

quality_gates:
  - No JavaScript style mutations in component code
  - All hover effects work identically to current implementation
  - No accessibility regressions
  - Code is more maintainable and follows React best practices
  - Performance improved (no runtime style calculations)
