title: "[IDASH] Add structured API logging for latency and errors
description: |
  Introduce structured logging around /api/* route handlers with correlation IDs
  to capture latency, status codes, and errors. Avoid logging PII.

  - agent/observability
  - phase/1
assignees: []
milestone: Phase 1 â€” Stabilize & Secure
acceptanceCriteria:
  - Route handlers log request ID, method, path, status, and latency.
  - Errors include stack context but scrub PII.
  - Simple inspection shows logs emitted during local calls.
files:
  - invoice-dashboard/src/lib/server/logging.ts
  - invoice-dashboard/src/app/api/**/route.ts
steps:
  - Create logging utility with correlation ID generation.
  - Wrap route handlers to measure and log latency and outcomes.
  - Verify logs in local development.
