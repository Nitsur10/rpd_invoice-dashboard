**Status**: In Progress  
**Input**: Expert review identified critical architecture issues requiring systematic fixes

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. ‚úÖ Parse dashboard architecture issues from expert review
2. ‚úÖ Extract key problems: CSS v4 compliance, font loading, semantic HTML, performance
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Mark resolved: Most issues addressed, error boundaries remaining
4. ‚úÖ Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. ‚úÖ Generate Functional Requirements
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Identify Key Entities (component variants, error handling)
7. üîÑ Run Review Checklist - In Progress
8. Return: NEAR SUCCESS (90% complete, error boundaries pending)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need: Better performance, accessibility, maintainability
- ‚úÖ WHY it matters: Professional dashboard experience, developer productivity
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW implementation details (already being implemented)

### GitHub Issue Creation Strategy
Using **spec-kit-project** methodology for systematic tracking:
1. **Specifications-driven**: Each issue backed by clear acceptance criteria
2. **Phase-based implementation**: Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation
3. **Constitutional adherence**: Simplicity, testability, observability

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **developer maintaining the RPD Invoice Dashboard**, I need the codebase to follow modern React/Next.js best practices so that I can efficiently add features, debug issues, and ensure consistent performance across all browsers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Tailwind CSS v4 with current globals.css, **When** building project, **Then** no CSS conflicts or build warnings
2. **Given** font loading configuration, **When** page loads, **Then** no font flash (FOUT) and consistent typography
3. **Given** dashboard page structure, **When** using screen reader, **Then** proper landmarks and navigation flow
4. **Given** animation-heavy components, **When** viewing on 60fps displays, **Then** smooth animations without jank
5. **Given** component props and variants, **When** creating new cards, **Then** consistent styling with type safety

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user has reduced motion preferences? ‚úÖ **Resolved** - CSS respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- How does system handle JavaScript failures? ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending** - Error boundaries needed
- What occurs during theme switching? ‚úÖ **Resolved** - Smooth 500ms transitions

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### ‚úÖ **Completed Requirements**
- **FR-001**: System MUST use Tailwind v4 `@layer theme` syntax for proper build compatibility
- **FR-002**: System MUST load fonts consistently without FOUT using `display: "swap"`
- **FR-003**: Dashboard MUST provide proper semantic HTML with ARIA landmarks
- **FR-004**: Animations MUST use `transform3d` for GPU acceleration and 60fps performance
- **FR-005**: Components MUST use class-variance-authority for type-safe variants

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending Requirements**
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- **FR-007**: Components MUST handle loading and error states consistently
- **FR-008**: Dashboard MUST provide accessible error recovery flows

### Key Entities
- **Card Variants**: Type-safe styling variants (primary, success, warning, danger, neutral)
- **Icon Variants**: Consistent icon theming with animation states
- **Badge Variants**: Status indicators with semantic meaning
- **Error Boundary**: React error catching and recovery mechanism
