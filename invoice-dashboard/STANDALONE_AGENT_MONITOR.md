- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress bars for active tasks
- **Current task display**: See exactly what each agent is working on
- **Performance metrics**: Tasks completed, average duration

### **2. Development Analytics**
```
📊 Quick Stats Dashboard:
├── Total Tasks: Running count of all tasks
├── Completed: Successfully finished tasks  
├── In Progress: Currently active tasks
└── Avg Time: Average task completion time
```

### **3. Activity Log**
